# Measurement tools

Scripts that produce every performance number quoted for Mini-Redis. Each one builds the server itself, so a result always comes from a known commit and build type, and each writes its results together with the machine, compiler, flags and commit it ran on.

| Script | Measures | Output |
|---|---|---|
| [`bench.py`](bench.py) | Requests/s and latency for SET and GET, pipelined and not, AOF on and off, against Mini-Redis and real Redis | `throughput.md`, `throughput-runs.csv` |
| [`replay_bench.py`](replay_bench.py) | Startup time for AOFs of increasing size, and how it grows | `replay.md` |
| [`cpu_profile.py`](cpu_profile.py) | Where the server's CPU time goes (`perf` + flame graphs, kernel included) | `profile.md`, `*.svg`, `*-top.txt` |
| [`memory_layout.cpp`](memory_layout.cpp) | `sizeof` of the storage types, and heap bytes per key | stdout |
| [`idle_clients.py`](idle_clients.py) | Whether the server survives N open connections (the `select()` limit) | stdout, server log |

Results live in [`results/`](results/), one directory per measured version (for example `results/v0-baseline/`).

## Running

Linux only (they read CPU times from `/proc`). Python 3.8+, standard library only.

```bash
sudo apt install redis-tools redis-server   # redis-benchmark, and real Redis for comparison
sudo systemctl disable --now redis-server   # the package starts a service on port 6379

python3 bench/bench.py        --out bench/results/<name>
python3 bench/replay_bench.py --out bench/results/<name>
cmake -B build && cmake --build build --target memory_layout
./build/memory_layout > bench/results/<name>/memory-layout.md

# Profiling also needs perf, the FlameGraph scripts, and kernel symbols:
sudo apt install linux-tools-generic
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph ~/tools/FlameGraph
sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1 kernel.kptr_restrict=0   # until reboot
python3 bench/cpu_profile.py  --out bench/results/<name>/profile
```

`bench.py` takes about 25 minutes with the defaults; `--runs 1 --requests 100000` gives a quick check of the setup.

## Method, and why

- **A fresh server for every run,** in an empty temporary directory. Mini-Redis replays its AOF at startup and the file grows with every write, so reusing one would measure a different server each time.
- **The same durability for both servers.** Mini-Redis hands each AOF record to the OS without `fsync`; Redis runs with `--appendfsync no`, which is the same guarantee. Both are also measured with AOF off. RDB snapshots and automatic AOF rewrites are off for Redis, so neither can start in the middle of a run.
- **Random keys** (`-r 100000`). Without `-r`, every request uses one key, the best case for hash lookups and CPU caches.
- **Server and client pinned to different CPUs** with `taskset`, so they never compete for one CPU.
- **Two `redis-benchmark` threads.** The client makes about as many system calls per request as the server, so a single client thread can run out of CPU before the server does, and the result would then measure the client.
- **Middle of 3 runs, with the spread shown.** One run can be off for reasons unrelated to the code. The spread ((max − min) / median) says how much to trust a row: compare two versions only when the difference is clearly larger than both spreads.
- **Runs interleaved:** every combination once, then all again. Slow drift, such as a laptop heating up and throttling, then affects all combinations alike instead of whichever ran last.
- **CPU use recorded for both sides.** A single-threaded server at 100% of a core is the bottleneck, so the row measures the server. If the server is well below 100% while the client is near its limit, the row measures `redis-benchmark`.
- **Optimised build enforced.** The scripts build `RelWithDebInfo` (`-O2 -g`) into `build-bench/` and refuse Debug or sanitizer builds.

## Limits of these numbers

- **WSL2 and hybrid CPUs.** Under WSL2, Linux sees virtual CPUs; pinning keeps the server and client apart, but Windows still decides which physical core runs each one. On a CPU with performance and efficiency cores, that adds noise. Numbers from different sessions or machines are not comparable; compare versions measured in the same session.
- **Loopback only.** Client and server share one machine, so there is no real network latency, and the client's own CPU use competes with the server's.
- **`redis-benchmark` is closed-loop:** each client waits for a reply before sending the next request. When the server stalls, fewer requests are sent, so the stall shows up in fewer samples than it should (coordinated omission). Its p99 is therefore optimistic. An open-loop load generator is planned.
- **`redis-benchmark` 7.0 has no random seed,** so each run uses a different random key sequence. That is part of the run-to-run spread.
